# My Ubuntu Scripts
This is just a collection of my common Ubuntu scripts. I'm not a very experienced Linux user, and I found myself having to search the internet for the same stuff everytime I had to install a system with Ubuntu. Main purpose is for myself to not have to search the internet for this all again.
